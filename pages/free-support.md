## Forum

Forum is the best way to reach EPESI developers directly. There we answer all kinds of questions and help with problems encountered by EPESI users. Developers can get there help with installation, data import, bugs and advice on how to use the framework for particular needs. We try to answer questions posted on forum within a week or less.

----------

## User manual

Our user manual explains all main areas of EPESI and helps with getting started, managing records, settings, etc. It's written in a way that is easy to follow for everyone, with lots of screenshots and comments. It is continuously a work in progress, so some sections might not be well-covered.

----------

## Framework documentation

This part is for developers. We have a site dedicated entirely for EPESI documentation. There are most common functions and uses described. It is a work in progress, so some parts of code might not be described here. If you find yourself in a need of information about these parts, please state your questions on our forum.
