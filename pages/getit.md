There are three options to get EPESI:

1. DIY - free
2. Hosting
3. Enterprise


## Installation and setup guide

EPESI is a web application which is installed on a web server - we will call it EPESI Web Application Server, or simply EPESI Server. To learn how to set it up go to the section Setting up EPESI Web Application Server

To use EPESI you need a computer with Internet connection and a web browser, which connects to EPESI Server and acts as a client. We will refer to a client frequently as a browser.

You don’t need to do anything special to configure your client/browser. In fact, if you are reading this it means that you already have fully configured browser with working Internet access. There are many browsers available for many operating systems and EPESI works very well on almost all of them.

**It has been tested and used on:**  
- Windows operating systems (XP, Vista, 7, 8 etc.)  
- Apple OS X, iOS  
- Linux  
as well as tablets running iOS and Android OS.


**EPESI is compatible with the following browsers (clients)**:   
- Chrome (preferred)  
- Firefox  
- Opera  
- Safari  
- Internet Explorer*

## Setting up EPESI Web Application Server

To run your own EPESI Server you need to have properly configured HTTP server with PHP support and a database engine. While this is generally a task for an experienced IT person, today there are many options available to end users which make the process very simple and easy.

There are few ways to get EPESI, we will try to recommend the best one for you.
First question to pose is whether you have your own web server - dedicated or shared.

####1. Customer's own web server (DIY - free)

If you manage your own web server and would like to make use of it, you can choose one of the 3 do-it-yourself installation method depending on your computer skills.

This way of installation is completely free, but it requires time and skills from you or your employee. Still, you're not completely on your own - we provide whole set of free tools and support to help you with your EPESI.

- **Softaculous Autoinstaller** - first and the easiest way is the auto installation with Softaculous Autoinstaller ([http://www.softaculous.com][1]) which is integrated into leading Control Panels like cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, InterWorx, H-Sphere. You can get EPESI within few clicks and after few minutes start enjoying it!
- **EPESI Easy Installer** - second method, just a bit more difficult, is an easy install with Sourceforge.
- **Manual installation** - the third option is to manually download EPESI from Sourceforge and then upload it to your own server via FTP client.
An experienced administrator can install EPESI using shell.

####2. Our web server - hosting (paid service)
